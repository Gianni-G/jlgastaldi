I am a philosopher and historian of science, specialized in philosophy and history of formal knowledge (mathematics, logic and computer science), from the beginning of the 19th century to our days

My research focuses on the formalization of meaning as a central problem of modern and contemporary philosophy, determined by a complex articulation between logic, mathematics and semiology. Developing the principles of historical epistemology, I propose an understanding of the emergence and evolution of formal knowledge, from early 19th century mathematized logic to contemporary computer science, guided by the problematic constitution of a theory of formal languages at the intersection of natural and social sciences.


I am currently leading an H2020 project, in collaboration with theoretical computer scientists and linguists, aimed at developing a semiology of mathematics by providing a conceptual and technical framework for the automatic analysis of mathematical corpora, based on a generalization of new techniques of grammatical inference for natural language.
