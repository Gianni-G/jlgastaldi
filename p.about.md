# About



After graduating with a degree in political sciences (UNR, Argentina), I continued my studies in philosophy and mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure of Paris, as well as at the universities of Paris-1 and Paris-6. I defended a PhD with a dissertation on the mathematization of logic in the 19th century. From 2012 to 2019, I was a Professor in philosophy and History of Ideas (tenured in 2018) at the Fine Arts Academy of Montpellier (MO.CO.ESBA). During 2012-2013, I was a Fellow at the Akademie Schloss Solitude (Stuttgart). From 2019 to 2023, I have been a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the ETH Chair of History and Philosophy of Mathematics. Currently, I am pursuing a second PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, with a focus on Natural Language Processing. I am also an external researcher at the SPHERE laboratory of the Université de Paris and I was a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh), and a regular visiting scholar at CUNY (New York).
